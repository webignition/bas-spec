Syntax Notation
===============

Syntax definitions follow a specific notation taking the following general form.

.. include:: includes/syntax/notation/form.rst

The ``definition-block`` section defines the syntax. The ``description-block`` section describes the purpose of
non-literal values, giving either a type, range for values or expanded definition.

A solid line of hyphens separates the definition from the description. It is neither part of the definition nor description.
