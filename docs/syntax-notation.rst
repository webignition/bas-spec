Syntax Notation
===============

Syntax definitions follow a specific notation taking the following general form.

.. include:: includes/syntax/notation/form.rst

The ``definition-block`` section defines the syntax. The ``description-block`` section describes the purpose of
non-literal values, giving either a type, range for values or expanded definition.

A solid line of hyphens separates the definition from the description. It is neither part of the definition nor description.

.. include:: includes/syntax/notation/notation.rst

Any characters within the definition not encapsulated in curly or square brackets and which are not the pipe character
are literal. Literal characters do not denote any special purpose and to be present as-is.
